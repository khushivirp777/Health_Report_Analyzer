# Health_Report_Analyzer


The **Health Report Analyzer** is an innovative project developed during a **Datathrone** by the collaborative efforts of **WebOccult** and **Lucent Innovation** in Ahmedabad. Our project garnered recognition from the judges for its innovation. This ongoing project leverages cutting-edge technologies such as YAKE (Yet Another Keyword Extractor) and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to efficiently analyze health reports.

The primary goal of the Health Report Analyzer is to automate the extraction and analysis of critical information from medical reports, thus providing a streamlined and accurate tool for healthcare professionals. By utilizing YAKE, we ensure precise keyword extraction, while OCR technology allows us to convert different types of medical report images into editable and searchable data. This combination not only enhances the accuracy of data retrieval but also significantly reduces the time and effort required for manual report analysis.

We are continuously working on improving the functionality and expanding the capabilities of this tool to make it a comprehensive solution for healthcare data analysis.
